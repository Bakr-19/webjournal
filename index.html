    <h1>Welcome to my journel!</h1>
    <h2>What is this website for?</h2>
    <h3>This website is based on a project set by my tutor. Essential this website will show the things we have been working through for the past 3 weeks. I also featured a <strong>"about me page"</strong>
    , which talks about who is baker... well me. Additonally, this website was created by me so everthing you see was create with html and css. Most importantly, i cant spell well so please dont hate me for that.</h3>
    <h2>Stuff i learnt make this website</h2>
    <h3>Creating this website taught me alot about html and css. Firstly, it showed me how easy and simple to make websites are - Just with two very powerful languages. Secondly, it taught me to research more than watching a tutorial, which i was doing before.
      You really dont need a tutorial to make a website, just take notes on interesting things within the tutorial then impement in your way with your website. Lastly, it taught me how to make your website use animation and transitions which is awsome!
