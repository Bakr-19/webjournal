        <h2> What We Cover On This Week?</h2>

<h3> Week 2 or CSS and HTML Week. This week we learnt the fundamentals of CSS and HTML. We learnt things like tag, different selectors, attributes, fonts …etc  CSS is a declarative language and HTML is a Markup Language which means they are not your normal coding languages, rather they are used to create websites and website design. In fact im writing this text in HTML.</h3>

<h2> How did i find this week?</h2>

<h3> Prior to this course covering CSS and HTML, I had about 2 hours of experience. Not much, but nonetheless enough to get your head around what these languages do. In a nutshell, i found this week to very easy because like i said these two languages are not your normal coding languages, they are declarative languages that tells the browser what content should go where and the like of. </h3>

<h2> What kind of tips can you give us?</h2>

<h3>I think using CSS and HTML for only a couple of days, i CANT call myself a professional of any sort but for people that are looking to get into CSS and HTML, then remember it is not complicated. Here is a few tips, although i might change my mind on them:</h3>
<ol>
<li> Use W3Schools insead of MDN, because its more dumbed down</li>
<li> Use youtube and possible MDN if W3S is not giving you answers</li>
<li> Take inspirations from other websites</li>
<li> Remember CSS and HTML ONLY  are not going to make website looks the “Professional” you need Javascript for that one</li>

</ol>
