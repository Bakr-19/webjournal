        <h2> Week 3!!<h2>
          <h3> Week 3, is this week RIGHT NOW! We actually learnt SQL in week 2 but i guess iâ€™ll cover in week 3. SQL (Structured Query language) programming language design to store and processes information in a rational databases. With SQL, we learnt how to create a simple database aswell as perform queries of various take. We learnt Commands such as SELECT, INTO, VALUE, BETWEEN and many others. I really enjoyed learning SQL.<h3>
          <h2> Was it difficult for you to learn SQL?<h2>
          <h3>No, thankfully the language was easier than i thought. I never used SQL before but rather used Microsoft Access to create a database without the use of SQL. SQL fundamentals are easy to grasp, it is nothing like javascript because you are commanding the SQL programme to do specific events which are combined to create more complex ones. <h3>
          <h2> What else did you in Week3?<h2>
          <h3> Mostly worked creating this website, learning a lot of CSS and html. I really enjoy creating this website but it does give you a headache if you don't rest properly. We also covered a bit of Project management this week. Project management is a very important business process because establishes a framework for how the project will work out. I have done 2 years learning project management in college so this was not new to me.<h3>

              <h2>Dot notation?</h2>
              <h3>The picture on your left is a image of the first javascript file i made. We were practicing something called dot notation a concept used by many lanaguages to enter a objects property. We used the Math bulit-in object will simple math operations to generate a random number from 1 to 10.</h3>
              <h2>Functions?</h2>
              <h3>Moving slightly forward - towrards end of the week. We learnt how functions work. We learnt termnology like agruments, expressions and parameters. We also look at the different functions javascript provides, like an anymous function. There are three ways of creating functions. Here is an example that we created. it calls another function to perform an operation then sends that back to the orginal function for displaying.</h3>
