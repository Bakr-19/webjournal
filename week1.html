        <h2> What we did on this week?<h2>
          <h3>Week 1 entailed the beginning of our software engineering course. Without any questions, we began to learn about dot notation, a syntax that javascript and some other languages use to denote your entering an objects property. We kept going through fundamental concepts like Loops, Functions, Variables, Datatypes…etc  the list goes on. The whole purpose of this week is to refresh our programing skills with concepts that we should of know already.<h3>
          
          <h3> One interesting thing i learnt, that i didn't know before was template literals. Template literals are very useful for using variables strings as placeholders in your code. Another, interesting things i learnt in javascript is how simple it is to use. Before this, i was Studying C which was more difficult since the syntax is slightly different and more ancient to today’s standard. Nonetheless, Javascript really makes it easy to access information from arrays and variable compared to other languages. For example, if you want to length of a array or string, you just need to use the length method. In C, it wasn't that simple.<h3>
          
          <h3>  The concept of how functions work never got to me before. When we started learning javascripts functions, it was easy to understand of functions worked. In the past it was a confusing concept that i thought i could never get my head around. Thankfully, our tutor helped us understand functions and how they work. So besides functions everything was pretty straightforward but <strong> code wars </strong>  really helped me solidify all the fundamentals that we learnt in this week.<h3>
