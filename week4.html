        <h2> Document Object Model (DOM)</h2>
        <h3> Document Object Model is javascript way of communicating with your CSS and HTML. The Awesome thing with DOM is the ability for you to use a OOP(Javascript)  to design professional websites. You can add events that active when something is pressed or clicked. DOM makes your website less static and more dynamic by providing more functionality. </h3>
        <h2> Normalization </h2>
        <h3> In our Database/SQL side of the course, this week we covered normalization and their different types. We learnt up to 3NF (normalization form). Normalization is a operation done on a Rational database to make it easier to access data, prevent duplication and provide faster queries due to tables being able to link together. Oppose to this, we learnt what is a flat file. A flat file is basically a single file with a table of information that are not linked to other tables. We also learnt the ability to link tables in SQL with the the INNER JOIN</h3>
        <h2> Project Drumkit </h2>
        <h3> During this week we did to projects, but the drumkit was the proper project of the two. The first “Mini Project” Was a key code generator, which used the keydown properties to display of what key was pressed. With the drumkit, we used a new feature in our website, which is audio. The drumkit was mainly created with Javascript because alot of coding was need to map keys and press. But basically the code used a function and inside the function a switch statement. I used the parameter of the function the expression of the switch so that when the function is called a different case called therefore a different code is called. This is a much effective way of mapping keys to audio. Instead of using multiple new audio statements, i used only one. This singular statement’s sources was changed to play different sounds. Furthermore, i used another function and added an event listener to each div. I invoked the first function inside the second function and sent different arguments to the first function based on the div being clicked. The animation was a great accomplishment, and that took time to think about to.</h3>
